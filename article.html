  <h2>What My Fraternity Taught Me</h2>

  <p>By Joseph RR Templin</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A street gang with a house. That&#39;s all it is. We never had to buy our friends.&rdquo;¬ù Wonderful words of encouragement from my mother when I told her I was joining a Fraternity. Actually having a modicum of restraint at eighteen I did not point out to her that she and Dad met on a blind date set up by his Fraternity Big Brother, so my entire family is actually a product of RPI&#39;s Greek system.</p>

  <p>Thanks to Animal House and Old School, the general population is under the belief that Fraternities are breeding grounds for over-sexed alcoholic Blutos that plan gang rapes of innocent co-eds, paddle each other, and sacrifice chickens while wearing robes with secret symbols and chanting as they haze their pledges into mindless clones. The average Sorority Sister is a bleached blonde cheerleader that has trouble putting together a sentence without the words &ldquo;Oh my God&rdquo;, plays composite bingo, and has their nose so far up in the air that they could drown in a rainstorm. 15 years of Brotherhood in Pi Kappa Phi blow away these stereotypes and have taught me many things that I have been able to apply in the business world (as well as my personal life) to achieve what I have today.</p>

  <p>Once you put on your pledge pin the lessons and leadership opportunities begin: I was Treasurer of my Pledge Class for Pi Kappa Phi Alpha Tau (aka the Castle), my first foray into money management and my current career. Pretty quickly as a pledge you learn that the other members of your Class depend on you, and if you screw up everyone loses. Not quite the same level as an 18 year old Marine overseas, but much more responsibility than the average college freshman. And the responsibilities and opportunities grow once you become a Brother. That could be why Greeks dominate leadership positions everywhere in this country. Leadership is one of the critical business skills that are rarely formally taught on college campuses, and the Greek System has helped fill this void. Whether it is something as simple as coordinating study sessions and keeping the Castle clean or as complex as running a thousand man hour Haunted House raising tons of money and publicity for charity, Pi Kappa Phi kindled the early flames of leadership inside of me that burn brightly to this day.</p>

  <p>Service is another key thing my Fraternity taught me. Houses run because of people, the same as businesses and charities. Whereas the business world is for profit and typically involves pay, everything in the Fraternity gets done on a volunteer basis. It might not seem like volunteering to get up and spend several hours cleaning the House on a Saturday morning, but it is for the communal good. Helping a Brother study for a test when you would rather go to the gym or The Ruck because they need your expertise to get that B and maintain their scholarship can be a drag, but it makes another person better and is a good investment of time. Learning to sacrifice for the good of others is not listed in any college curriculum I&#39;ve seen, but it is common practice in the Fraternity world. Spending months planning and then an entire week building and running a Haunted House certainly can impact your grades. But we raised thousands of dollars for charity through our Haunted Houses, built a family home, donated a small ocean of blood, and dedicated tens of thousands of hours for community service. And I always got much more than I gave. This is where my principle of economic altruism was formed, and it keeps me dedicated to serving others to this day.</p>

  <p>Among the best things that the Castle gave me are some of the friendships. I was given the opportunity to meet men whom I would never have chosen as friends because I would have never met them under any other circumstances: a bigger than life Texan who could crack any computer code; a mathematics mad genius who will eventually win the Fields Medal that paid for his college by hustling fooz ball; a Blue Blood Bostonian who eventually became my best man. These are men that I as a farm kid trying to become a physics professor would never have met if it were not for the Castle, men who have been there for me in times of celebration or desperation. During my darkest personal times, it was the guys in the House that helped me. When one of my Brother&#39;s sister was killed in a car accident, I was the second person he called. When I got engaged, he was the first person I called. The second was a friend from another House who served as my co-best man. The third was a friend from yet another House that served as a groomsman and will be Godfather to my second child. All of these men I met only because of the Greek System. Friendships spread beyond the walls of an individual House into the entire Greek Community, something outsiders often overlook in their derision of a system that they can not comprehend.</p>

  <p>My Fraternity taught me to take advantage of opportunity. I have had the opportunity to meet Admirals and CEO&#39;s because they were Brothers of Pi Kappa Phi. I have randomly met people in the airport because they were wearing the same letters. I have done some of my biggest business deals with people from other Houses that introduced me to their Brothers or Sisters, and my call was accepted solely because of their Fraternal bond. I have met executives that instantly attach additional credibility to me just because of my Greek background. In business I will almost always hire a Greek over a non-Greek because of the proven track record, no matter GPA. The shared core values of most Fraternities causes almost instant respect in the business community as a peer, no matter when or where a person pledged. This greater Greek community, combined with the leadership development and time management skills honed in the House give Greeks a tactical advantage in life. The Greek system has given me these skills and the opportunity to use them, and I have.</p>

  <p>Beyond the leadership opportunities and friendships that I will carry for the rest of my life, the single greatest lesson my Fraternity taught me is the realization that being part of something bigger than you makes you grow. The Alpha Tau Chapter of Pi Kappa Phi is seventy five years old this year, and boasts 1200+ members. The Castle is a National Historic Landmark building that is over a hundred years old that has been used in movies such as The Age of Innocence and The Time Machine, and cost a million dollars to build in the 1890&#39;s. Pi Kappa Phi Fraternity has existed for a hundred years on the National level, and has about 100,000 Brothers. The Greek System at RPI has been around since before the US Civil War, creating generation after generation after generation of leaders in science and technology and business and education. The Greek community donates billions of dollars and millions of hours a year to charities. Every single day I get up and kiss my wife and son and thank God for them and for everything else that the Castle has given me, and every single day I try to live up to the Oath that I took in April 1991 to an ideal of Pi Kappa Phi. Not every day do I live up to it, and not every day does every Greek lives up to their Oath, but just the fact that we try every day to be better than what we were and to give more than we take makes most Greeks a better person and ultimately a contributor to the greater good.</p>
